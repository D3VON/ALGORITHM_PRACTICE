Repository: ALGORITHM_PRACTICE

This is an attempt to practice various algorithms (sorting, 
graphs, trees) and also languages like C/C++, Java, and perhaps
even something like Prolog.

Subdirectories are named for the languages I'm targeting.

Source code and executibles are in the same directories.
